Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Supply Chain Management(SCM) Dashboard using Tableau. This dashboard will help monitor and optimize various  aspects of the supply chain, including inventory levels, order fulfillment, supplier  performance, transportation efficiency, and overall supply chain costs.<br>
